    "**Three supervised learning models (SLM) that are appropriate for this problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Decision Trees. DT is the first SLM to consider. \n",
    "DTs are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "Some advantages of DTs are: Trees can be visualised. Requires little data preparation. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Able to handle multi-output problems. Uses a white box model. Easily explained by boolean logic. Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "Few disadvantages of DTs include: Does not support missing values. DT learners can create overfitting. Small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. DTs do not express all problems easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems. DT learners create biased trees if some classes dominate.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Gaussian Naive Bayes.  \n",
    "Naive Bayes algorithm based on conditional independence (CI) assumption. It is the simplest form of Bayesian network, in which all attributes are independent given the value of the class variable. CI makes it one of the most efficient and effective learning algorithms but independence is rarely true in real world. In fact, there is a local dependency.\n",
    "With Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification, the likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian.\n",
    "Some advantages of NB: NBs can handle missing data. NBs does not need a lot of data to perform well. Feature selection is the selection of those data attributes that best characterize a predicted variable. Calculate the probabilities for each attribute is very fast.\n",
    "Few disadvantages of NB: Strong independence assumption of features. Frequentist approach in case of data scarcity. The performance of NBs can degrade if the data contains highly correlated features. If a given class and feature value never occur together in the training data, then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero. This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Support Vector Machines. \n",
    "Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection. SVMs are based on the concept of decision planes that define decision boundaries. A decision plane is one that separates between a set of objects having different class memberships. SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.\n",
    "The advantages of support vector machines are: Effective in high dimensional spaces, even if the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient. Different Kernel functions, including common and custom, can be specified for the decision function.\n",
    "The disadvantages of support vector machines include: If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.Perhaps the biggest limitation of the support vector approach lies in choice of the kernel. Another limitation is speed and size, both in training and testing. The most serious problem with SVMs is the high algorithmic complexity and extensive memory requirements of the required quadratic programming in large-scale tasks.**\n",
